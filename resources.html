      <h3>How You Can Make a Difference</h3>
      <div class="vinfo">
        <h4>Time</h4>
        <p>
        You do not need to be a superhero to make a difference. During this time, we are in contanst need of compassion, kindness, patience, and a whole lot of laughter - an extra hand or two wouldn't hurt either! If you're looking to volunteer with Street Soldiers Troy, simply come to Baker Park for setup at 6:30pm. We kick off festivities at 7pm, every Thursday evening, rain or shine.<br>
        <br>
        Looking for some more information? You can contact Robin Ford at <a href="mailto:streetsoldierstroy@gmail.com">streetsoldierstroy@gmail.com</a> or chat with one of our many volunteers at the office, simply call (518) 265-7026.<br>
        </p>

        We are absolutely honored to be the benefactor of the profits made from the designer himself, Richard Ruotolo, "The New Norm" t-shirt! This truly is a gift! Each dollor above cost (which is minimal) goes 100% to Street Soldiers || Troy!! We were on <a href="https://wnyt.com/capital-region-comeback/capital-region-man-designs-shirts-to-help-streetsoldiers-troy-organization/5738074/?cat=13526" target="_blank">Channel 13 News</a>. In case you missed it, the link is below to purchase a shirt or send one to your family afar while supporting your community.<br>

        <h4>Talk Around Town</h4>
          <blockquote class="quotes">
          "My family has gone from being pretty well on our own to needing some assistance over this past year. You are friendly and non-judgemental. We are a family that is too proud to ask for help, and I was embarrassed to come for the food or Christmas assistance, but you reassured me that this is why you guys are here. Made me feel better knowing you wouldn't treat me like I am below you. I appreciate all of your help in so many ways!" -Anonymous Recipient<br>
          <br>
          "Regular folks getting together to help regular folks" -Eileen V.<br>
          <br>
          "When I come in to donate and see people lined up down the sidewalk, I realize how lucky this community is to have you" -Victoria C.<br>
          <br>
          "You do so much with so little. Your volunteers work their tails off, and you get things done. I feel good knowing that my donations are going toward the programming. It's nice that you don't just spend money just because you can" -George H., Donor<br>
          <br>
          "Friends helping friends! No judgment just love" -Kelly C.
